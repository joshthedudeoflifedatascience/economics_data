Hypothesis:
- Is it possible to predict the unemployment rate due to the feds interest rate hikes?
- Using the following data we want to know what the effects on unemployment would be:
    - GDP
    - Corporate Profit
    - Corporate Cash on Hand
    - Consumer Sentinment
    - Labor Force Participation Rate
    - SP 500 Data
    - Unemployment Rate
    - Fed Funds rate
    - Drug Over Doses

How do we define a recession?
- The standard answer is a decline of GDP for 2 more consecutive quarters, given the historically low unemployment rate post COVID, and the actions taken by Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve in wake of the post Covid inflation surge, we believe that a delayed but mild recession of similar nature will happen in at the end of 2023.

- Recessions can last as long as several years (The Great Recession) to 2 months (the COVID Recession). Given the actions of the Federal Reserve with Quantiative Easing (QE) post the Great Recession, and post COVID interest rate surge, we believe that a recession would be short lived and the low unemployment rate wil bouy any effects that would have otherwise been catastorphic to a fragile economy.
